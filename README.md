## Architecture

This project follows a typical Blazor application architecture, with components, pages, services, and data access layers. The authentication and authorization functionalities are integrated using Identity, with Entity Framework Core handling data access to SQL Server databases. Razor components are utilized for building user interfaces and authentication pages, providing a flexible and interactive user experience.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Visual Studio 2022 installed with .NET 8 support.
3. Set up your SQL Server database and update the connection string in the project.
4. Run the application and explore the provided tutorials, code samples, and demonstrations.
5. Experiment with different authentication and authorization scenarios to deepen your understanding.
